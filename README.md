Welcome. If you have access to this repository then you are on the team and, clearly you know about it. 

Always remember that **_this not a techincal project_**. What we are doing is simply building a high speed, low latency, highly reliable and fault tollarant tickerplant. The design and implimentation of which is running in every high end investment bank in Manhattan. That doesn't mean that it won't be challenging or hard, it just means there is very little technical risk. å

**_This project is first and formost a political one._** So please keep this under wraps until we have the politics in place and gradually work it. if it's leaked before we have the political infrastructure and prototype, the it will be very difficult to bring it to fruition. But when we do, it will blow away the already encroaching number of competitors in the ad space.

Finally, use this project to polish your craft of programming and software development. The q language is a hard clime, it will take a number of months to fully appreaciate its power and elegance, but when you twist your head from the conventional procedual way of thinking like c, to a function programing way of thinking like q, and finally get to the peak where you can think and type in q as easily as you do any other languge, you'll find it is well worth it. 

Plus, what can go wrong? Reach out to me whenver you get stuck or frustrated. I've done renovations and new builds of large tickerplants many times and q is my favorite programming language.

## Where to start

Below you'll find a brief history of all q. After that there are annotated links to online materal and finally I uploaded my raw q directory that I have been carrying around for years. I have highlighted some of the items in it that are useful when getting started in q. You are encouraged to browse around in it. 

### History of kdb+ and q

The q is language was written in k which was developed by Auther Whitney after having developed a number of variations like A and A+ at Morgan Stanley. Auther's langauges were strongly inspired by APL which was writen 1962 by Ken Iverson. As Auther once told me, his father was a friend of Ken Iverson's and the name "k is a tribute to Ken.

AT&T had an early and big role in all of this, as the story goes... 

>One summer weekend in 1989, Arthur Whitney visited Ken Iverson at Kiln Farm and produced—on one page and in one afternoon—an interpreter fragment on the AT&T 3B1 computer. I studied this interpreter for about a week for its organization and programming style; and on Sunday, August 27, 1989, at about four o’clock in the afternoon, wrote the first line of code that became the implementation described in this document.

I know Auther personally and have worked with him many times over the years. He is in New York now and then, I get him to visit sometime when we are all back in the office.

### Online material

1. http://kx.com
- The Kx website. You can download a version of q and kdb+ for both your mac and your dev box from here. They will have you signup so that they can send you a license key that will enable a full fledge version but with a maxium memory. Kdb+ is the real-time in memory database build for large datasets like Console DB. The tickerplant's conceptual functionality is similar to Batches & Kafka. Customized analytics and applications including exchanges like Impbus are writen the the q. 

Start with the kdb+ FAQ at https://kx.com/media/2018/10/Kx-FAQ.pdf then start browsing the white papers and the site in general.

2. https://code.kx.com/
- This is a developers' website, where there is code from kx as well as user contributed code. Kx has a large community in New York City, they have regular meetings help locally each moth of so (when we could.) First Derivatives, who I once worked for, was initially a consulting and sales support company for Kx but has since purchaed the rights for kdb and q. They holds meetups and conferences all over the world.

3. Google "kdb conference videos" for an endless number of interesting tutorials and talks.

### Bob's Vault

This is a the raw directory that I have been carting around for years andhave uploaded here to git. Feel free to browse around. Here are some places to start.

* https://stash.corp.appnexus.com/users/rw052t/repos/phoenix/browse/q/Q%20for%20Mortals
- The book "Q for Mortals." (I hate the title of the book and its overused phrase "Q Gods" I think is disrespectful and arrogant) That not withstanding, it is  the best book for staring with q. With the except for the first chapter, (skip it, it's just there to make you fell stupid), it is really good book from Chapter 2. It's best read as an interactice experience by sitting at a running version of q on your laptop or dev machine and cutting and pasting the examples and playing with them. I have the individual chapters separated as I would print a chapter and carry it wite me and read on the train to learn it. There are two copies of all the whole book in there as well.

* https://stash.corp.appnexus.com/users/rw052t/repos/phoenix/browse/q/Cookbook
- A small sample of the collection of "cookbook" solutions to many common problems from the Kx website 

* https://stash.corp.appnexus.com/users/rw052t/repos/phoenix/browse/q/docs
- Documents for the various components. More recent version are probably on the kx websites

* https://stash.corp.appnexus.com/users/rw052t/repos/phoenix/browse/q/Developer%20Briefs
- Again, stuff of interest from the Kx websites

# Books

*  https://is.muni.cz/www/jirqa/The.Mythical.Man.Month.F.Brooks.pdf
- The Mythical Man Month, By Fredrick P. Brooks, Jr. is a must read before starting any project like this. You are strongly encouraged to read it.
