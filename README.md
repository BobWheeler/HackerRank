Welcome. If you have access to this repository then you are on the team and, clearly you know about it. 

Always remember that this not a techincal project. What we are doing is simplly building a high speed, low latency, highly reliable and fault tollarant tickerplant. The design and implimentation of which is running in every high end investment bank in Manhattan. That doens't mean that it won't be challenging or hard, it just means there is very little technical risk. *This project is first and formost a political one.* So please keep this under wraps until we have the politics in place and gradually work it. if it's leaked before we have the political infrastructure and prototype, the it will be very difficult to bring it to fruition. But when we do, it will blow away the already encroaching number of competitors in the ad space.

Finally, use this project to polish your craft of programming and software development. The q language is a hard clime, but when you twist your head from conventional thinking and get to the peak where you can think and type it as you do any other languge, it is well worth it. Plus, what can go wrong? Reach out to me whenver you get stuck or frustrated. I've done renovations and new builds of large tickerplants many times.

## Where to start

Here are some links online materal and then files and directorys in my stuff that are useful if your starting q.

### History of kdb+ and q

The q is language was written in k which was developed by Auther Whitney after hedeveloped a number of variations at Morgan Stanley. Auther's langauges were strongly inspired by APL which as writen 1962 by Ken Iverson. As Aurthr once told me, his father was a friend of Ken Iverson, the "k" is a tribute to Ken.

AT&T had a big role in all of this, as the story goes.

>One summer weekend in 1989, Arthur Whitney visited Ken Iverson at Kiln Farm and produced—on one page and in one afternoon—an interpreter fragment on the AT&T 3B1 computer. I studied this interpreter for about a week for its organization and programming style; and on Sunday, August 27, 1989, at about four o’clock in the afternoon, wrote the first line of code that became the implementation described in this document.

I know Auther personally and have worked with him many times over the years. He is in New York now and then, I get him to visit sometime when we are all back in the office.

### Online material

1. http://kx.com
- The Kx website. You can download a version of q and kdb+ for both your mac and your dev box from here. They will have you signup so that they can send you a license key that will enable a full fledge version but with a maxium memory. Kdb+ is the real-time in memory database build for large datasets like Console DB. The tickerplants like Batches & Kafka as well as customized analytics and applications including exchanges like Impbus are writen the the languge q.
